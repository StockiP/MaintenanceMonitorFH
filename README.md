# MaintenanceMonitorFH Introduction
 Maintenance Monitor for BWI Technikum SLM
 This project is implemented in the context of the course "Software Lifecycle Management" at the FH Technikum Wien. The framework conditions for the project are as follows:

#Task
 We are a small hydro-power electricity supplier near Vienna. Our customers expect electricity around the clock with a service level agreement of 99.95%. 
 This means that a maximum outage of 21 minutes and 54 seconds (monthly in sum) is tolerated. 
 It is easy to derive that service times are very important to us. Huge monitors were installed that should show a green monitor in case everything looks fine and a red monitor in case of problems.
 All monitors show the same content: a maximized website.
 
#Project
 A team of max 3 members should implement a REST-based server in Java (use Jax-Rs). The service should be able to manage a centrally stored message and hereby capable to:
 1. reset the message
 2. set it to a specific message
 3. deliver the message to the clients
 
 using REST.
 
 Create a web frontend which is capable to query the message every 5 seconds.
